# Headgear Peripheral Design Documentation

## Team Organization
Our team was separated into two teams, input and output. Members of both teams assisted in setting up the principle hardware, such as the RasPi. 

### Input Team
The input team consisted of Cameron Cassidy, Eric Anderson, Jonathan Pape, and Josiah Hamid-Khani. They researched various input devises for spatial perception and decided to use a LIDAR Lite for the initial prototype. After additional research, they opted to use a thermal camera and computer vision for the final product. Due to COVID, the thermal camera did not come in. However, an algorithm using OpenCV was developed and lightly tested. 

### Output Team
The output team consisted of Cole Smith, Nic Flug, and Ross Young. After researching various methods of communicating with users, they decided to utilize vibrohaptics. The prototype consisted of a single Arduino Lilypad and communicated the presence of a potential hazard. The final product would have used two Lilypads. By using two, we would be able to communicate the position of a potential hazard to the user.
