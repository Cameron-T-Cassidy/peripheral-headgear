This project is not currently looking for more contributors. Due to the hardware based nature of the project, 
any software modifications will not be physically implemented on our original helmet prototype.

Pull requests are allowed for the entire project for those who would like to build a blind spot notification 
helmet for themselves. Code commits must be approved by the repository owners through a pull request. Please
follow good coding practices. All python code must be written in python 3 with tab indentations, NOT SPACES!
For questions about contributing, you may message the owner of this repository.
