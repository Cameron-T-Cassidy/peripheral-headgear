# Peripheral-Headgear for Blind Spot Monitoring
This repository is for team headgear peripheral, a team from the 2020 CSCE482 capstone course at Texas A&M University. The project consists of a Lidar sensor sending distance data to a Raspberry Pi 4 running the Raspian OS. When the distance to an object is below a certain threshold, the Pi will trigger a vibration notification to the user. All components are mounted on a helmet for use while downhill skiing or snowboarding.

For more technical information about the project please view our [Wiki](https://github.com/rossmichaelyoung/peripheral-headgear/wiki).
